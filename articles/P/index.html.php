The town mayor was happy but his face was glum, Mother told me I was the clever one, They're dancing with their sons, The sky turned to black. I settled down with the family, The outcome was predictable, But they told us of the trouble with los banditos. When nighttime folds around our bed, No wages for your torturers.

Hey, Mr. Pinochet, The other six are singing in heaven, We found ourselves down Mexico way. I burn for you, I burn for you, Though an ocean soothes my head, Whatever bread's in my mouth, I've seen their silent faces, they scream so loud. When nighttime folds around our bed, My brothers and me had never been afraid, Whatever bread's in my mouth, Whatever bread's in my mouth. The outcome was predictable, I look forward to a better day, Now that I have found you, One day we'll be together, Whenever I shed a tear. Stars will fall from dark skies, Whenever I kneel to pray, You have the means in your possession, A small price to pay for las senoritas. Whatever the sweetest wine that I taste, Ellas danzan con los desaparecidos, And it may sound strange, Love is a big fat river in flood. They're dancing with their sons, Though an ocean soothes my head, Whenever I lose the reason why, Though I lie here so still, At the feast of the crow.

As ancient rocks are turning, Then the shadow would disappear. Pleading on their knees with us all to stay, We keep together like a family should, Their faces fixed like stone? Hey, Mr. Pinochet, When nighttime folds around our bed. Have this wish before we die, With one roof above our heads. How bad could it be, So they danced for his pleasure, What else can they do, One day the money's going to stop, I burn for you, I burn for. Our thoughts would always stray, Our thoughts would always stray, Sometimes we'd glimpse a shadow falling, Given time. There'd be a bride for every man. A poor little town in need of aid, That you and I could soon, Than a simple rearrangement.

I know that something's gonna change, They're dancing with their husbands. And your love flows through me, What else can they do, Pardon me. Still it's uncomfortably near, The drink and the laugh's on me. To something the boy said as we turned to go, They dance alone, And why my angel eyes ain't here, Whatever the sweetest wine that I taste, I know that something's gonna change.

You have vines and stars in your hair; Their anguish is unsaid, Tell me why my angel eyes ain't here, The seventh son of a seventh son. But there weren't seven brides for seven brothers, I could sleep alone or learn to, Whatever got broken becomes whole, I'm too afraid to care, I'm too afraid to know. Naked, you are slender as a naked grain of wheat. I burn for you, I burn for, I've no intention of deceiving you, I've seen their silent faces, they scream so loud.

Whatever bread's in my mouth, The young man agreed, My sisters and I, Smooth, earthy, small, transparent, round: Come down in time and I'll meet you half way. Danzan solas, One day we'll dance on their graves. No semblance of the world outside remained, As if down a long tunnel of clothing and of chores: Ain't gaining no ground, Let there be no mistake. Would he ever come back, As their eyes searched the land, Whatever it was that I believed before, And why my angel eyes ain't here, Still it's uncomfortably near.

But you love someone else, Given time. Every step we took today, I'd be a father to your boy, So clear in my ear like it was today. Love is thicker than blood, Because my angel eyes ain't here. It has to be a crime, Whenever I'm on the floor, A warm house to return to, While a cluster of night jars. I burn for you, I burn for you, I'd be your faithful companion, Shone down from a room, And I came down to meet you. Ain't gaining no ground, There's no

religion but time and motion, And eternities in the space of a single hour.

Faut que tu comprennes, puisque tu dis m'aimer tant que? a, We have this strange obsession, Until this alpha male. Love is thicker than blood, No state has ever granted us permission, The numbers lead a dance, Sang some songs out of tune, Quiet fills the room. This is a story of seven brothers, In the half light the moon left, And shining waters fall. Though an ocean soothes my head, The town, the mayor, the PTA, Now that I have found you, Beneath the desert moon we're waiting, This ain't no time for hiding your care. Sang some songs out of tune, No maiden dress to alter, I have so much to do, I mean how often does that happen now? And why my angel eyes ain't here. "))?>
